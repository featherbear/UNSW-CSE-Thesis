+##
+## color foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
+## or
+## icolor foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
+##
+## "color" will do case sensitive matches, while "icolor" will do case
+## insensitive matches.
+##
+## Valid colors: white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, cyan.
+## For foreground colors, you may use the prefix "bright" to get a
+## stronger highlight.
+##
+## To use multi-line regexes, use the start="regex" end="regex"
+## [start="regex" end="regex"...] format.
+##
+## If your system supports transparency, not specifying a background
+## color will use a transparent color.  If you don't want this, be sure
+## to set the background color to black or white.
+##
+## If you wish, you may put your syntaxes in separate files.  You can
+## make use of such files (which can only include "syntax", "color", and
+## "icolor" commands) as follows:
+##
+## include "/path/to/syntax_file.nanorc"
+##
+## Unless otherwise noted, the name of the syntax file (without the
+## ".nanorc" extension) should be the same as the "short description"
+## name inside that file.  These names are kept fairly short to make
+## them easier to remember and faster to type using nano's -Y option.
+##
+## All regexes should be extended regular expressions.
+
+## Key bindings
+## Please see nanorc(5) for more details on this
+##
+## Here are some samples to get you going
+##
+# bind M-W nowrap main
+# bind M-A casesens search

+### Sample Wget initialization file .wgetrc

+## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
+## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
+## to find out what you can put into this file. You can find this here:
+##   $ info wget.info 'Startup File'
+## Or online here:
+##   https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Startup-File
+##
+## Wget initialization file can reside in /etc/wgetrc
+## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
+##
+## To use the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
+## as well as change them, in most cases, as the values on the
+## commented-out lines are the default values (e.g. "off").
+
+
+##
+## Global settings (useful for setting up in /etc/wgetrc).
+## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
+## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
+##
+
+# You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
+# optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
+# default quota is unlimited.
+#quota = inf
+
+# You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
+# downloading a file (default is 20).
+#tries = 20
+
+# Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
+# prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
+# the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
+#reclevel = 5
+
+# By default Wget uses "passive FTP" transfer where the client
+# initiates the data connection to the server rather than the other
+# way around.  That is required on systems behind NAT where the client
+# computer cannot be easily reached from the Internet.  However, some
+# firewalls software explicitly supports active FTP and in fact has
+# problems supporting passive transfer.  If you are in such
+# environment, use "passive_ftp = off" to revert to active FTP.
+#passive_ftp = off
+passive_ftp = on
+
+# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
+# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
+# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
+# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
+# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
+#waitretry = 10
+
+
+##
+## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
+## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
+## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
+##
+## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
+## are doing before doing so.
+##
+
+# Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
+#timestamping = off
+
+# It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
+# header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
+# you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
+#header = From: Your Name <username@site.domain>
+
+# You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
+# is *not* sent by default.
+#header = Accept-Language: en
+
+# You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http, https, and ftp.
+# They will override the value in the environment.
+#https_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
+#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
+#ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
+
+# If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
+#use_proxy = on
+
+# You can customize the retrieval outlook.  Valid options are default,
+# binary, mega and micro.
+#dot_style = default
+
+# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
+# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
+# the default!
+#robots = on
+
+# It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
+# the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
+#wait = 0
+
+# You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
+# retrieved, by setting this to on.
+#dirstruct = off
+
+# You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
+# you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
+#recursive = off
+
+# To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
+# to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),
+# set this variable to on:
+#backup_converted = off
+
+# To have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default, set this
+# to on:
+#follow_ftp = off
+
+# To try ipv6 addresses first:
+#prefer-family = IPv6
+
+# Set default IRI support state
+#iri = off
+
+# Force the default system encoding
+#locale = UTF-8
+
+# Force the default remote server encoding
