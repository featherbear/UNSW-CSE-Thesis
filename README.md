Hello! You've stumbled upon the repository containing all the research that I've done for my thesis at UNSW.  
Long story short, I'm taking a "quick perusal" at a smart home robotic vacuum cleaner to see if it's doing something up to no good, as well as to see if there are any vulnerabilities in how it operates.

Have a look at the website version of this repository here: [featherbear.cc/UNSW-CSE-Thesis](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-CSE-Thesis)
