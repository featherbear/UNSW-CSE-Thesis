<h2 id=iot--2018---michael-steigerwald-vtrust>IoT | 2018 - Michael Steigerwald (VTRUST)</h2>
<p>In 2018 the security research group VTRUST (2018) analysed a line of
white-labelled IoT product revisions based from the IoT manufacturer
Tuya. Despite supposed claims of ‘military-grade security’, basic packet
logging of network activity concluded that “the analysis of the ‘smart’
devices using this basic platform is generally frightening”, with
“serious […] shortcomings”. It was revealed that amongst various
<strong>PII</strong>, encryption keys and the device’s serial number (used to target
a specific device through remote commands) were insecurely transmitted
over the network - allowing a malicious user on the same wireless
network to eavesdrop on the communication. Furthermore, during the
initial setup and pairing of the IoT device, wireless credentials were
also insecurely transmitted in plain text, allowing wireless network
credentials to also be observed.</p>
<p>VTRUST commented on the dangers of vendors selling white-label products,
where anyone could become a so-called ‘IoT company’ regardless of
“having in-depth technical knowledge of IoT or IT security”. As a result
of the hands-free approach to security and privacy for both direct and
indirect customers of the IoT platform, concern is raised regarding the
ease of distributing maliciously modified devices; where firmware could
be tampered at any stage during the supply chain. It is of significance
to recognise that the majority of custom firmware releases or so-called
“hardware hacks” have originated from the desire to decouple hardware
from online and official cloud services. These attempts effectually
disconnect devices from the internet, and limit their connectivity to a
local server where communications are transparent and minimal.</p>
<p>As a result of many Tuya-powered devices using the widely popular
<a style="text-decoration:underline dotted" href=https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266>Espressif
ESP8266 SoC</a>, VTRUST was able to exploit discovered vulnerabilities
to perform over-the-air upgrades of custom firmware such as
<a href=https://esphome.io/>ESPhome</a> and
<a href=https://tasmota.github.io/docs/>Tasmota</a>. Their automated flashing
tool PoC <code>tuya-convert</code> allowed consumers to easily integrate these
devices with local home automation software such as
<a href=https://www.home-assistant.io/>HomeAssistant</a>. As a result of
VTRUSTS’s findings, the overall security posture of modern Tuya-powered
devices has since improved<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, with implementations of local flash
memory encryption and firmware signing measures during over-the-air
firmware upgrades.</p>
<h2 id=iot--20172018---xiaomi-dafang-hacks>IoT | 2017/2018 - Xiaomi Dafang Hacks</h2>
<p>Methods of ‘rooting’ IoT devices has been widely addressed, often out of
the necessity to gain shell access to the device prior to any further
research or development. To facilitate offline firmware upgrades for
devices that might not have outbound internet connectivity, devices may
execute scripts or boot from removable flash memory such as SD Cards.
Kotlyar (2017) demonstrated the ability for the inexpensive Xiaomi
Dafang WiFi Camera to boot into a custom <code>u-boot</code> bootloader flashed
onto a microSD card. Through UART headers located on the device’s
circuit board, the boot environment was able to be modified to start a
shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>) instead of the original entry-point script,
effectively rooting the device. This invited Kotlyar to dump the
firmware and later produce a custom firmware release that did not rely
on the vendor’s cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id=iot--smartphone-application-security-assessment>IoT | Smartphone Application Security Assessment</h2>
<p>Jmaxxz (2016) investigated the security claims of a smart doorlock which
boasted in bank-grade security, and better security over conventional
lock and key methods. Various flaws within the smartphone application
however invalidated these claims, as it was discovered that access to
lock settings were purely client-side checks, and as such; requests to
the server could be modified to elevate privileges. Various debug menus
were present in the production version of the application, allowing
certificate pinning protections to be subverted. Furthermore, lock
events and other identifiable information were being transmitted to a
logging endpoint.</p>
<h2 id=bga-shorting-to-gain-access-to-fel>BGA shorting to gain access to FEL</h2>
<p><img src=../../../uploads/20211115-boot-sequence.png height=300px alt=center>
<img src=../../../uploads/20211115-Snipaste_2021-11-15_19-45-37-dgiese.jpg height=300px alt=center></p>
<p>For devices that do not automatically boot into removable media, methods
have been discovered to force certain SoC’s to enter a recovery or
fallback mode.</p>
<p>On Allwinner-based SoCs, a programming mode known as “FEL” can be
entered by pulling a certain pin LOW during boot<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, which allowed
device manufacturers to perform initial image flashing and bootloader
configurations. It can be noted that FEL mode can also be entered if the
SoC failed to successfully start the bootloader. Giese (2019) identified
this fact and exploited the physical layout of the Allwinner R16 BGA
package, where the data pins connected to the MMC / eMMC chips were on
the physical perimeter of the SoC. By sliding a piece of electrically
conductive aluminium foil (roughly 0.02mm thick) between the circuit
board and the solder plane of the SoC (0.3mm), the data pins could be
momentarily shorted for long enough to cause the bootloader read
operation to corrupt and fail, hence booting into FEL mode. This was a
favourable result as compared to pulling the FEL pin low during boot -
as access to the FEL pin would require the desoldering and removal of
the SoC, due to the pin being physically inaccessible when soldered
without a test pad.</p>
<p>Once FEL mode has been obtained, the boot environment can be configured
to drop a shell, allowing for further post-exploitation methods and
firmware dumping / analysis.</p>
<p>It is noted that on the circuit board of the Roborock S7 vacuum cleaner,
pin <code>TPA17</code> is connected to the ball grid location corresponding to the
FEL pin - allowing FEL mode to be entered without shorting the data
pins.</p>
<h2 id=flash-ic-dumping-hardware>Flash IC Dumping Hardware</h2>
<p><img src=http://www.saelig.com/miva/graphics/00000001/848pro725_350x189.jpg alt=center></p>
<p>In situations where no provisions exist to programmatically extract
stored data from a system (i.e. shell access to perform disk imaging),
hardware devices known as flash programmers can be used; where they are
specially designed to read and write data on flash chips. Flash
programmers however present a high cost overhead, as they are rather
costly and only work with specific models and/or types of flash chips;
rendering it infeasible to own a specific flash programmer for each
possible variation of flash chip. Jimenez (2016) points out that a
Raspberry Pi could be used as an affordable budget solution when paired
with open source flash programming software like
<a href=https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom><code>flashrom</code></a></p>
<p>It is noted that the process of hardware flash chip dumping is not
feasible in the scope of this thesis due to resource constraints of not
possessing a suitable flash programmer, as well as the risk associated
with hardware-based methods being possibly destructive with irrevocable
damage. Preliminary results (TODO: SEE SECTION? ) have however suggested
that firmware data can be obtained through programmatic methods, and as
such this method will not be pursued.</p>
<h2 id=2014---firmware-analysis>2014 - Firmware Analysis</h2>
<p>In 2014, Costin et al. (2014) performed a broad static analysis over a
large number of firmware images to identify common patterns and
similarities between different product vendors. During the analysis of
the 693 images, 38 new vulnerabilities were discovered, some which were
present in the majority of images. Hardcoded keys and credentials were
also discovered</p>
<p>To facilitate the similarity analysis of firmware images, where per-byte
analysis techniques are nonsensical, tools like
<a href=https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk>binwalk</a>,
<a href=https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep>ssdeep</a>, and
<a href=https://github.com/sdhash/sdhash>sdhash</a> were employed - which help to
facilitate file exploration relative to their file type and
architecture.</p>
<p>A large proportion of images shared similarities in code execution
graphs, indicative that a large number of vendors had simply used and
repurposed sample code (often available as part part of a SoC’s SDK).
Given the commonality of vulnerabilities, concern is raised as to the
vendor’s technical capability and understanding of IoT systems.</p>
<h2 id=vacuums-in-the-cloud-analyzing-security-in-a-hardened-iot-ecosystem>Vacuums in the Cloud: Analyzing Security in a Hardened IoT Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Regarding prior investigations of smart robot vacuum cleaners, Ullrich
et al. (2019) performed a security analysis on the <em>Neato BotVac
Connected</em> robot. Through the combination of a cold-boot attack - where
a system is rebooted without the volatile memory (i.e. RAM) being
cleared - and the booting of a custom bootloader image, the memory state
of the system’s prior execution (inclusive of loaded binaries as well as
their application state) was able to be dumped and analysed. The
proceeding analysis revealed major vulnerabilities and concerns in the
vacuum cleaner and more alarmingly, in Neato’s cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Whilst logs and coredumps were encrypted when transmitted to cloud
servers, the encryption keys were discovered to be hardcoded which
nullified any premise of encryption. Furthermore, authentication and
authorisation tokens were all encrypted with the same static RSA key -
which left the cloud infrastructure vulnerable to impersonated
identities and access. Supposed randomly generated keys were also
discovered to be vulnerable, due to the keyspace for entropy being so
short that the key was able to be bruteforced within reasonable time.</p>
<p>An unauthenticated endpoint on the robot vacuum cleaner’s remote port
was found to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow, allowing remote code
execution on the robot by anyone connected to the same wireless network.</p>
<h2 id=lidar---acoustic-eavesdropping>LIDAR - Acoustic Eavesdropping</h2>
<p><img src="https://eak2mvmpt4a.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Guide-to-Lidar-Wavelengths-Velodyne-Lidar-AlphaPrime-1.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt></p>
<p>As more and more IoT devices become online and sensor data is
transmitted around the world, there grows popularity to thoroughly
investigate the extents of what data can be retrieved from the sensors.
Given the outputs of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors being
intensity and distance, intensity measurements when pointed towards an
audio source were able to be processed and translated back into audio
signals - allowing speech to be identified from micro-vibrations within
objects (Wei et al. 2015).</p>
<p>This research has since been continued and tested on robot vacuum
cleaners which too posses LIDAR sensors. As consequent to off-the-shelf
LIDAR sensor units being used within the vacuum cleaners, light
intensity values were also returned by the sensor, and could also be
used to in a similar fashion to detect speech and sound (Sami et al.
2020). In the application of a robotic vacuum cleaner, light intensity
values are considered a side-channel concern as those values are not
required for the operation of a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Despite integration limitations of sampling intensity values on a vacuum
cleaner (i.e. accounting for the continuous rotation of the LIDAR sensor
and noise floor as a result of the vacuum engine), a classification
accuracy of 91% was achieved when extracting sensitive data such as
digits of a credit card</p>
<p><img src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/cdaf0753c4b991623b9413270b0d9ceff8a6e730/2020/11/19/2f9e0e96-c3e5-4cdc-b9bb-24022efd5b3b/lidarphone.png?fit=bounds&auto=webp" alt=center></p>

<h2 id=xiaomi-iot-ecosystem>Xiaomi IoT Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Giese (2019) performed a security assessment over a broad range of
Xiaomi’s IoT products to examine how secure their ecosystem was. Through
a series of UART commands and keystroke injections as well as hardware
fault injection techniques, shell access into various Xiaomi-partnered
robot vacuum cleaners (running Linux or some variant of Android) was
obtained. In his research it was concluded that due to the enormous size
of Xiaomi’s ecosystem, it was difficult to enforce global security
policies between the different vendor-provided plugins due to deprecated
functions and APIs still being used by legacy devices. It was also
concluded that Xiaomi does indeed treat their security concerns
seriously, as they have had been quick to respond to security incidents
and vulnerability reports.</p>
<p>From this research, a <a href=https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud>vacuum cleaner cloud
emulator</a> was built, allowing
complete offline functionality of robot vacuum cleaners without
requiring internet connectivity. This research also paved the way for
other third party software to be developed, such as
<a href=https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo>Valeduto</a> - which provides a
standalone web interface to the vacuum cleaner’s functions</p>
