Thesis projects are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for your creativity, and the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of results. Typically, the project you work with will have multiple possible solutions or conclusions and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning.</description></item><item><title>What Goes In A Thesis</title><link>/docs/about-the-thesis/what-goes-in-a-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/about-the-thesis/what-goes-in-a-thesis/</guid><description> A thesis is a highly structured document, not a brain dump!
