With demands for such devices growing by 12% each year [@ResearchMarkets-2021], this AU$130B industry has cordially invited thousands of households to invest in smart devices such as light bulbs, fans, televisions and fridges.</description></item><item><title>2.

Through these partnerships, vendors buy into the IoT manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem - namely being the product itself, the companion smartphone application, and the cloud infrastructure supporting backend communications - all without requiring vendors to posses any knowledge or understanding of how to design, develop nor manufacture the IoT products that they sell.</description></item><item><title>3.

Despite claims of &amp;lsquo;military-grade security&amp;rsquo;, basic packet logging of network activity concluded that &amp;ldquo;the analysis of the &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; devices using this basic platform is generally frightening&amp;rdquo;, with &amp;ldquo;serious [&amp;hellip;] shortcomings&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>4.

This thesis aims to explore the stance and measures that Roborock has taken regarding privacy policies and security concerns in their Roborock S6 robot vacuum cleaner.</description></item><item><title>5.

A DHCP server was set up to serve address leases on the 10.10.10.0/24 network, where the IPv4 address of the vacuum cleaner is dynamically issued to simulate a general home network.</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/report-c/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/report-c/conclusion/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>/docs/report-c/todos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/report-c/todos/</guid><description>Abstract TODO: Write this at the end
