Through these partnerships, vendors buy into the IoT manufacturer’s ecosystem - namely being the product itself, the companion smartphone application, and the cloud infrastructure supporting backend communications - all without requiring vendors to posses any knowledge or understanding of how to design, develop nor manufacture the IoT products that they sell.</description></item><item><title>What Goes In A Thesis</title><link>/docs/about-the-thesis/what-goes-in-a-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/about-the-thesis/what-goes-in-a-thesis/</guid><description> A thesis is a highly structured document, not a brain dump!
