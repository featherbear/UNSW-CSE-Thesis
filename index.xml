Thesis projects are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for your creativity, and the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of results. Typically, the project you work with will have multiple possible solutions or conclusions and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 1</title><link>/docs/example-doc/chapter-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example-doc/chapter-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is chapter 1 of example doc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 1</title><link>/docs/example-doc/nested-chapter/chapter-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example-doc/nested-chapter/chapter-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is chapter 1 of nested chapter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 2</title><link>/docs/example-doc/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example-doc/chapter-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is chapter 2 of example doc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 2</title><link>/docs/example-doc/nested-chapter/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example-doc/nested-chapter/chapter-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is chapter 2 of nested chapter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Useful Meetings</title><link>/docs/about-the-thesis/useful-meetings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/about-the-thesis/useful-meetings/</guid><description> What did you do since the last meeting What are the obstacles you are facing How have you tried to overcome them What will you do before the next meeting</description></item><item><title>What Goes In A Thesis</title><link>/docs/about-the-thesis/what-goes-in-a-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/about-the-thesis/what-goes-in-a-thesis/</guid><description> A thesis is a highly structured document, not a brain dump!
