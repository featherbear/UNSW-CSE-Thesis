So after reassembling the unit and powering it via external wires.. the unit keeps trying to rotate itself, and continually yells out "Charging"; also the voltage fluctuates between 17-19V (it should be charging at around 19.5V)

The pads on the bottom of the unit connect to the circuit board with some wires - one seems to have a \[ferrite\] core; or inductor of sorts - whereas my external wires don't have that (perhaps I should add one)

But despite that I've tried

* Connecting the charging station spring contacts to the pads
  * Still yells charging
* Putting some reflective surface over the cliff sensors
* Putting the charging station over the pads
