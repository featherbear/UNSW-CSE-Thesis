Following a quick scribble of notes I wrote four months ago how I might go about [making an image of the system](../system-imaging/) for offline analysis purposes, I finally found the time (and motivation) get get around working on my thesis again :')

I didn't want to make an on-board image of the system since

* Bad idea to write to the file system of the file system you're trying to clone...
* There's not enough free space anyway

So I decided to pipe the output of a `dd` command through SSH.

# SSH Access

According to `iptables`, inbound access to the SSH port (22) is blocked

    root@rockrobo:~# iptables -L
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    DROP       udp  --  anywhere             anywhere             udp dpt:6665
    DROP       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:6665
    DROP       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh
    
    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    
    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination       


```
root@rockrobo:~# iptables -S
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 6665 -j DROP
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 6665 -j DROP
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```

So first we'll need to enable access, by deleting the drop rule.  
(You can find the rules by doing `iptables -S`, and then replacing `-A` with `-D`)

> `iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j DROP`

Note that this rule gets added back by some scripts running on the system, so you'll need to patch those files

# SSH Auth

I added my public key to the OpenSSH server (`SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2.3`)

> `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@10.10.10.8`

***

# Backup

    for partition in `ssh root@10.10.10.8 "ls /dev/mmcblk0?* -1"`
    do
        ssh root@10.10.10.8 "sudo dd if=$partition bs=1M" | dd of=$(basename $partition).img
    done

This made a backup of each individual partition on the remote eMMC chip, and stored it locally on my computer

***

# Mapping

Later I can correlate the partition backups to their labels and purpose which I had documented in [eMMC Layout](../emmc-layout/) and [fdisk dump](../fdisk-dump/)

## fstab

Also this

    root@rockrobo:/# cat /etc/fstab
    # UNCONFIGURED FSTAB FOR BASE SYSTEM
    tmpfs /tmp tmpfs size=30m 0 0
    tmpfs /run/shm tmpfs size=100m 0 0
    /dev/mmcblk0p1      /mnt/data/              ext4  defaults 0 0
    /dev/mmcblk0p6      /mnt/default/               ext4  ro 0 0
    /dev/mmcblk0p10     /mnt/updbuf/                ext4  defaults 0 0
    /dev/mmcblk0p11     /mnt/reserve/               ext4  defaults 0 0

## TODO

`cat /proc/mtd`
