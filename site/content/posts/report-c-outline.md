## Abstract

## Acknowledgements

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

### Threat Scenarios

## Background / Literature Review

## Work Performed

### Scope of Assessment

### Summary of Contributions

Summary + mini table of contents?

### Network Setup

Diagram

\[Vacuum\], \[Traffic Dummy\], AP, Switch, Port Mirror, Mirror Sink, Router

### Analysis of Device Pairing Procedure

Insecure transmission of wireless credentials.

Violates Tuya's security white paper, despite integrating Tuya's service

### (Not a result - Firmware Extraction)

Dump command

UBoot command line -> hold s

### Binary File Comparison against Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

### Proof of Concept: Remote Access

### Proof of Concept: Reset Persistence

### Proposed Exploit: Upgrade Persistence

### Discovered Vulnerability: RCE via locked ADB

### Identified Network Behaviour

Network capture

### MUD Profiles

> [https://github.com/ayyoob/mudgee](https://github.com/ayyoob/mudgee "https://github.com/ayyoob/mudgee")

MUD profiles for versions: v01.15.18, v02.29.02

**Limitations: Baseline ground-truth  
**There are likely other ports and addresses that were not identified during the packet captures

**Limitations: Payload packing  
**MUD files do not perform deep packet inspection, nor does it decode SSL traffic. Limited to blocking unexpected addresses and ports.

## Evaluation

### Recommendations

ðŸ”¥ Further transparency in disclosures  
 ðŸ”¥ Improved privacy policy  
 ðŸ”¥ Pairing encryption  
 ðŸ”¥ Data should be cleared on device disassociation  
 ðŸ”¥ Better co-ordination between ecosystems and vendors  
 ðŸ”¥ MUD files - both devices and infrastructure  
 ðŸ”¥ Whitepapers, bug bounties

De-elevate access

## Conclusions

## Future Work

* Update MITM
