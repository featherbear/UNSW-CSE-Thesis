#### Identified Network Behaviour

Network capture

### MUD Profiles

> [https://github.com/ayyoob/mudgee](https://github.com/ayyoob/mudgee "https://github.com/ayyoob/mudgee")

MUD profiles for versions: v01.15.18, v02.29.02

Show flow table

\**Limitations: Baseline ground-truth  
\**There are likely other ports and addresses that were not identified during the packet captures

\**Limitations: Payload packing  
\**MUD files do not perform deep packet inspection, nor does it decode SSL traffic. Limited to blocking unexpected addresses and ports.


#### Proof of Concept: Remote Access




### Filesystem

#### (Not a result - Firmware Extraction)

1. TPA16 is the GND
2. TPA15 is the deviceâ€™s RX pin
3. TPA 8 is the deviceâ€™s TX pin

Remote dump over SSH

UBoot command line -> hold s

##### Discovered Vulnerability: RCE via locked ADB

    [5991703.724675] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 4 using xhci_hcd
    [5991703.881398] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1f3a, idProduct=1001, bcdDevice= 2.33
    [5991703.881400] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
    [5991703.881402] usb 1-2: Product: Rockrobo ruby
    [5991703.881403] usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Rockrobo USB Developer
    [5991703.881404] usb 1-2: SerialNumber: 8a80ab8936d76c118000

`adb_lock`


#### Networking

IPv6 and iptables
WatchDoge, rrlogd

### Upgrade Analysis

#### Proposed Exploit: Upgrade Persistence

#### UBoot modification

#### Changes

root password

/mnt/default/shadow

busybox

ipv6 / iptables here instead?  watchdoge; rrlogd

## Evaluation

### Recommendations

ðŸ”¥ Further transparency in disclosures  
ðŸ”¥ Improved privacy policy  
ðŸ”¥ Pairing encryption  
ðŸ”¥ Data should be cleared on device disassociation  
ðŸ”¥ Better co-ordination between ecosystems and vendors  
ðŸ”¥ MUD files - both devices and infrastructure  
ðŸ”¥ Whitepapers, bug bounties

De-elevate access

## Conclusions

## Future Work

* Update MITM
