\**Limitations: Baseline ground-truth  
\**There are likely other ports and addresses that were not identified during the packet captures

\**Limitations: Payload packing  
\**MUD files do not perform deep packet inspection, nor does it decode SSL traffic. Limited to blocking unexpected addresses and ports.

## Evaluation

### Recommendations

ðŸ”¥ Further transparency in disclosures  
ðŸ”¥ Improved privacy policy  
ðŸ”¥ Pairing encryption  
ðŸ”¥ Data should be cleared on device disassociation  
ðŸ”¥ Better co-ordination between ecosystems and vendors  
ðŸ”¥ MUD files - both devices and infrastructure  
ðŸ”¥ Whitepapers, bug bounties

De-elevate access

## Conclusions

## Future Work

* Update MITM
