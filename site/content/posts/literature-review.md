## 2018 - Michael Steigerwald (VTRUST)

> Talk: [Smart home - Smart hack](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9723-smart_home_-_smart_hack)

* Products from different manufacturers used the same cloud infrastructure (with supposed 'military-grade security'), each with their own 'customised' (white-label) smartphone apps
* Used the <a style="text-decoration: underline dotted" href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266">Espressif ESP8266</a> chip
  * WiFi-enabled SoC with Arduino support
  * Often used by tinkerers and enthusiasts
* Anyone can become an 'IoT company' regardless of "having in-depth technical knowledge of IoT or IT security."

> _"The analysis of the 'smart' devices using this basic platform is generally frightening [...] serious [...] shortcomings"_

* Insecure transmission of encryption keys, serial number, etc...
* Insecure transmission of wireless credentials during pairing
* Ease of white-labelling and starting your own IoT business
  * Ease of selling malicious devices

Automated flashing tool `tuya-convert` created that exploited prior vulnerabilities to flash custom decoupled firmware  
(i.e. [ESPhome](https://esphome.io/), [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/), etc...)

### Tuya's Response

* 28th January 2019 - [patch](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Smart-Home-Hack-Tuya-veroeffentlicht-Sicherheitsupdate-4292028.html) released _(later subverted)_
  * TLS encrypted firmware update procedure
  * Encryption of flash memory
* 3rd January 2020 - [new patch](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/483) released
  * unbreakable‚Ñ¢
* 23rd April 2020 - Switched from the ESP8266 to a custom SoC
  * [Tuya WB3S](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/483)
* 16th June 2021 - Announced official support for HomeAssistant

## LIDARPhone - 2020 - Acoustic Eavesdropping

> 2015 - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2789168.2790119

> 2020 - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3384419.3430430

* LIDAR sensor detects minute vibrations that are induced on objects near audio sources
* Vibrations are extracted and turned back into sound waves
* Extraction of sensitive data (i.e. credit card digits)
* Achieved 91% classification accuracy

## Vacuums in the Cloud: Analyzing Security in a Hardened IoT Ecosystem

> https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot19/presentation/ullrich

* AM335x Microprocessor
    * ARM Cortex-A8
* Cold-boot attack
    * USB + Serial communication allowed boot into custom image
    * RAM could be dumped to the serial port
* Extraction of keys
    * Auth/Authz to the robot AND cloud
* Secret key RNG weak - able to bruteforce
* RSA key was shared with all devices
* Identity impersonation
* Logs and coredumps were encrypted :)
    * But encryption keys were hardcoded :(
* Buffer Overflow -> RCE

## 2014 - Large-scale Firmware Analysis

> https://www.usenix.org/node/184450.

* Broad analysis of a large number of firmware images
* Discovered 38 new vulnerabilities over 693 images
* Similarities in vulnerabilities
* Static analysis and extraction of keys, credentials, configs, other 'tells'

----

## Fuzzy Binary Analysis

> https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk  
> https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep  
> https://github.com/sdhash/sdhash  

* Source code changes largely remain the same
* But binary files change 'arbitrarily'
* Difficult to compare binary files

## IoT | 2017/2018 - Xiaomi Dafang Hacks

[![center](https://gh-card.dev/repos/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks.svg?fullname=)](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks)  
[![center](https://gh-card.dev/repos/samtap/fang-hacks.svg?fullname=)](https://github.com/samtap/fang-hacks)

* Cheap WiFi camera that can be made to boot off a microSD card
* Circuit board exposed UART (`baud_rate=115200`) pins that allowed interaction with U-Boot bootloader
* Modification of boot environment to start `/bin/sh` ([[link]](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/blob/master/hacks/getroot.md))
* Gain root shell access
* Dump firmware
* Analyse, modify and package updated firmware

## Xiaomi Ecosystem | 2017-2019 - Dennis Giese

> Paper: [`SEEMOO-MSC-0142`](https://dontvacuum.me/thesis/Security_Analysis_of_the_Xiaomi_IoT_Ecosystem.pdf) (July 10, 2019)

- Research available: [dontvacuum.me](https://dontvacuum.me)
- Performed security analysis of a range of Xiaomi products
- Found ways to root the Mi Home Robotic Vacuum Cleaner and the Roborock S6
  * UART, hardware fault injection, etc...
- Developed cloud emulation software ([DustCloud](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud))
- Research led to development of 3rd party software (i.e. [Valeduto](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo))

> "How secure is the implementation of the ecosystem of the IoT market leader Xiaomi?"

### Conclusions

* ‚åö The company quickly responds to security concerns
* üîç Many exposed endpoints of deprecated APIs
* üîì Many devices do not enforce proper HTTPS checks
* ü§ù Difficult to enforce security for plugins (vendor-provided)
* ‚ùì CIA principles generally kept
