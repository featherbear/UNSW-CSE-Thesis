**Define the problem:** with the topic description as starting point, you need to describe in more detail what the problems are or what the product is. You also need to motivate the work and say why it is important that it should be done.

***

**Survey the literature:** you need to determine what the key developments in the area are, and in particular, how they relate to your topic. Describe, compare and analyse the competition.

***

**Present your options:** describe and compare the alternative methods that could be applied to solve the problems that you have identified, or the (alternative) steps involved in making the product. Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods.

***

**Plan your attack:** decide on the method(s) that are most appropriate, and justify your decision(s). Plan how you will do the work, and check with your supervisor that your plan is realistic. Note that you will be using this plan in Thesis Part B.

***

**Solve the problem:** carry out your plan and either develop a solution to the research problem, or build the system.

***

**Evaluate your solution:** justify why your solution is a good solution. For a theory problem, this may already be clear from the solution (proof) itself. For other kinds of research problems, you might do some complexity analysis or build a simulation. For software development, you need to carry out a testing plan which analyses relevant aspects of the system such as correctness, performance, usability, etc.
