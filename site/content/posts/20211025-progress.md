## Observations

**Pairing**

Internet required to pair the Roborock to a Mi account

* _makes sense though_

**Data Encryption**

> Data is encrypted through SSL (HTTPS) as well as in-protocol encryption

Good!

**Protocols?**

* QUIC
* RPC (noticed in Xiaomi Home app, on the homepage of the Roborock device)

**Addresses**

DNS -> sg.api.io.mi.com

**Every 2 seconds**

* 161.116.5.107 -> RoboRock (UDP 8053 to 48041) - len=112
* RoboRock -> 161.116.5.107 (UDP 48041 -> 8053) - len=336

**\[Find Robot\] Function (Xiaomi Home)**

* 161.117.5.107 -> RoboRock (UDP) - len=96
* RoboRock -> 161.117.5.107 (UDP) - len=64

***

* Packet with len=32 ... keepalive?
* Renaming doesn't send any update packet?

## Wireshark Filter for TZSP

> i.e. Port Mirroring from the Mikrotik router

    tzsp && !stp && !(ip.dst == 192.168.0.24 || ip.src == 192.168.0.24) &&  !(ip.dst == 10.10.10.2 || ip.src == 10.10.10.2)

***

## Note

* Initial connection from Xiaomi Home to the Roborock required internet (to load the main 'plugin' page)
  * After initial connection, internet could be disconnected and some features were still able to work?
    * Possibly bad firewall-ing of the internet
* Could not see local network activity between the Xiaomi Home app and the Roborock
  * Don't use Port Sniffing on the router!
    * The switch does not forward packets to the router
    * Use the switch's port mirroring functionality instead
