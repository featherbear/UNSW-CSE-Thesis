The device that I had was manufactured in June 2020 (06/2020).  
Unfortunately this means that MiIO OTA updates are blocked.

If you ever wanted some older stock image... [https://vacuumz.info/download/s6/stock/](https://vacuumz.info/download/s6/stock/ "https://vacuumz.info/download/s6/stock/")

# MiIO Client 3.5.4

Looks like the miIO client was patched - <s>and a set of commands were removed; though remnants existed here and there</s> they added code to handle and drop an OTA update

Instead of being handled by the broadcast routine (yellow), it just prints out "Recv OTA CMD!!!" and then that's it...

> FYI - I renamed the subroutine `broadcast`

When the handler parses the packet, after going through the other handlers, it then passes the message to be broadcasted (locally)

The AppProxy should reply with something (here it seems it's because it knows it's not connected to the internet?)
