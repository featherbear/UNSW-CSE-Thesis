Removed the logic board from the robot and had a look at the pins near the Allwinner R16 processor / SoC. Read Dennis' writeup about the UART pins being located on RX:TPA15, TX:TPA8, GND:TPA16

I then soldered some wires onto the test pins (too hard to just hold it with my hands)![](/uploads/20211029-20211030_025959.jpg)

Was able to connect to the device with baud rate 115200.  
Read [\[here\]](/uart-preboot-communications/) for the communications dump.

According to these lines in the uboot [source code](https://github.com/allwinner-zh/bootloader/blob/master/u-boot-2011.09/board/sunxi/board_common.c#L843-L847) holding `s` drops us into a shell

After [enumerating](/uart-preboot-communications/) through the different partitions, we can find the file `vinda` in emmc device 2, partition 6. This file contains an `XOR(0x37)`'d copy of the `root` password

After the decryption, [we're root](../i-am-root)!

Also had a quick look at the best ways to back up the filesystem (for analysis).  
Later will also need to see what online analysis things there are to do
