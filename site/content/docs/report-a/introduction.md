The adoption of consumer-grade Internet of Things (IoT) devices has been both widespread and constantly growing. With demands for such devices growing by 12% each year [@ResearchMarkets-2021], this AU$130B industry has cordially invited thousands of households to invest in smart devices such as light bulbs, fans, televisions and fridges. Giving the abundance of products and affordability, it has become an integral part of many homes, where 4 in 5 consumers would be more inclined to choose a property over another if the former were to have such technologies. [@RichBrown-2015]

Whilst the benefit of convenience is sought after from smart home devices, these technologies do come with hidden costs and risks. Behind the seemingly 'simple', 'smart' and 'secure' product features that attract the general populus, a hidden complex network of services and devices are present in the background, where functionality is often obscured and private. Without the transparency of what data is being sent, and of where that data is being sent to, consumers inevitably pay for convenience with not only their money but with their privacy and security.

Whilst manufacturers and vendors may claim to be secure and/or confidential in how they treat **UGC** and **PII**, it lies evident from various incidents that we cannot completely trust such claims. From involuntary exposure of leaked Facebook user data [@LawrenceAbrams-2021], to rumours of corporations monetising user data without consent [@RhettJones-2017], there lies an equal need for consumers to understand the terms of service to which they agree under, but additionally for companies to be audited against those very same terms of service.

The infrastructural security and product security of IoT devices must also fall under scrutiny given the rapid product lifecycle of IoT developments [@DennisGiese-2021]. As security is often not a sellable feature in contrast to new products and most mistakenly, convenience, proper and wholistic security precautions are often overlooked by companies who are more concerned with money gain and high return on investments. Consequently, the prevalence of malicious actors in the cyberworld is abundant, where the overall lack of security awareness between consumers invites target devices to be easily accessed with default passwords or through unpatched vulnerabilities[^shodan_webcam]

With the rising availability of convenient and consumer-friendly Internet of Things devices, there is an increasing demand for users to connect more devices to their home network. Consequently, the unknown nature of communication and of what data is communicated raises both privacy and security concerns that may often be overlooked or trivialised in exchange for convenience. This project will involve the audit of an internet-connected robotic vacuum cleaner (Roborock S6) to assess the internal operations and nature of data that is transmitted, as to investigate any potential vulnerabilities that may render the device insecure.
