The Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Home devices are everywhere...  
From smart lightbulbs, to smart fridges... to ... [*] smart ... flip-flops?
We can't seem live without them, but...  should we really be living _with_ them?

Now regardless of where you stand in the pro or anti smart device debate, the matter of fact is that the adoption of these devices into our daily lives have been widespread.

Of course though, everything comes at a cost.

The question lies upon us, can we completely trust the claims that manufacturers promise about our security and privacy?

Unfortunately, it is hard to fully place such trust. [*] Developers are humans, and as humans we naturally make mistakes. Or perhaps, companies wish to profit off from us, whether that be monetarily or politically, or whatever it is... Our data is their currency.

Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, Roomba selling data?

We should always verify and test things ourselves where possible!
