abstract = {Loudspeakers are widely used in conferencing and infotainment systems. Private information leakage from loudspeaker sound is often assumed to be preventable using sound-proof isolators like walls. In this paper, we explore a new acoustic eavesdropping attack that can subvert such protectors using radio devices. Our basic idea lies in an acoustic-radio transformation (ART) algorithm, which recovers loudspeaker sound by inspecting the subtle disturbance it causes to the radio signals generated by an adversary or by its co-located WiFi transmitter. ART builds on a modeling framework that distills key factors to determine the recovered audio quality. It incorporates diversity mechanisms and noise suppression algorithms that can boost the eavesdropping quality. We implement the ART eavesdropper on a software-radio platform and conduct experiments to verify its feasibility and threat level. When targeted at vanilla PC or smartphone loudspeakers, the attacker can successfully recover high-quality audio even when blocked by sound-proof walls. On the other hand, we propose several pragmatic countermeasures that can effectively reduce the attacker's audio recovery quality by orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Private conversations are an attractive target for malicious actors intending to conduct audio eavesdropping attacks. Previous works discovered unexpected vectors for these attacks, such as analyzing high-speed video of objects adjacent to sound sources, or using WiFi signal information. We propose LidarPhone, a novel side-channel attack that exploits the lidar sensors in commodity robot vacuum cleaners to perform acoustic eavesdropping attacks. LidarPhone is able to detect the minute vibrations induced on objects that are near audio sources, and extract meaningful signals from inherently noisy raw lidar returns. We evaluate a realistic scenario for potential victims: recovering privacy-sensitive digits (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers) emitted by computer speakers during teleconferencing calls. We implement LidarPhone on a Xiaomi Roborock vacuum cleaning robot and perform a comprehensive series of real-world experiments to determine its performance. LidarPhone achieves up to 91% accuracy for digit classification.},
