1. Attacker planting persistence
2. Attacker far away
3. Attacker within proximity
4. Attacker with device physically compromised

TODO: Create Proof of Concepts
e.g Persistence planting via recovery image
* one command

* Try bad usb?

STRIDE

Spoof
Tampering
Repudiation
Information Disclosure
Denial of Service
Elevation of Privilege?

Evaluation: Should I use this device?
