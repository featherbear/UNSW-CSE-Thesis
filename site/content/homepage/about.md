## "Smart" Vacuum Cleaners

> An Audit Into The Security and Integrity of IoT Systems

With the ever-growing adoption of convenient and user-friendly Internet of Things devices, more and more objects around us have made their way onto the internet, requiring connectivity to the web for one reason or another. Despite the unknown nature of communication and limited transparency of data, such privacy concerns are often overlooked in exchange for convenience. This paper audits the Roborock S6 robotic vacuum cleaner to assess its internal operations and network activity behaviour, as to investigate any potential vulnerabilities that may render the device unsafe or insecure.

## Thesis Statement

How have manufacturers of IoT / smart home devices addressed the increasing concerns of digital privacy and product security?

## Conclusions

Manufacturers of IoT / smart home devices have addressed to privacy and security concerns by reacting with positive improvements and fixes, however better care must be taken to wholistically improve their privacy and security posture.

... sounds like a cop-out answer hey...
