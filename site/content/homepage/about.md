## "Smart" Vacuum Cleaners - An Audit Into The Security and Integrity of IoT Systems

With the rising availability of convenient and end-user friendly Internet of Things devices, there is an increasing demand for users to permit these devices to communicate remotely. Consequently, the unknown nature of communication and of what data is communicated raises privacy concerns that may often overlooked or trivialised in exchange for convenience. This project will involve the audit of an internet-connected robotic vacuum cleaner to assess the internal operations and nature of data that is transmitted, as to investigate any potential vulnerabilities that may potentially render the device insecure.
