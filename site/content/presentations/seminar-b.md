# Statement

>

How have manufacturers of IoT / smart home devices addressed the increasing concerns of digital privacy and product security?

> 

{{% fragment %}}
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

* Digital Privacy - Investigate the nature of network data (i.e. content, frequency, destination) and how the data is used.
* Product Security - Investigate potential security vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of current security fortifications.

* Why is there an SSH server running?
* What's running on port 6665
  * `player`
  * Why not file-based IPC?
* Can I ping the internet
  * Yep!
* Can I add persistent access?
  * Yes, modify `rrwatchdoge.conf`
  * Can also add remote access
    * e.g. ZeroTier

# Trivial Power Analysis

> Batteries dont't last forever!

<!-- lol you could have just opened it up in the first place -->

> What if I unplug the battery?

* No change in output during boot
* But device will turn off after around 20 seconds

# File System Imaging

The eMMC only has 4GB of storage, so we can't (also shouldn't) image the flash onto itself... but we can image it remotely! 

```bash
IP=10.10.10.8
for partition in `ssh root@$IP "ls /dev/mmcblk0?* -1"`
do
    ssh root@$IP "sudo dd if=$partition bs=1M" | dd of=$(basename $partition).img
done
```

# File System Structure

|partition|label|description|
|:--------|:----|:---------|
|mmcblk0p1 | UDISK | user data |
|mmcblk0p2 | boot-res | bootloader stuff |
|mmcblk0p5 | env | |
|mmcblk0p6 | app (RO) | device data |
|mmcblk0p7 | recovery | stock firmware |
|mmcblk0p8 | system_a | Main OS (boot) |
|mmcblk0p9 | system_b | Backup OS |
|mmcblk0p10 | Download | Update temp |
|mmcblk0p11 | reserve | blackbox??? |

# Recovery Reset

Recovery supposedly resets `system_a`, `system_b`, `UDISK` and `Download`

{{%center%}}<img src="/uploads/20220501-recovery.png" width="70%"/>{{%/center%}}

What about the other partitions? If we want to plant malicious software, can put it in `recovery` and `system_a`?

## Interesting Files

device.token=utnevRELra5sqef3
device.uid=1738271950
mmcblk0p1/rockrobo/




    mmcblk0p11\endpoint.bin
        AWS address + key?
    mmcblk0p6\adb.conf
        adb_lock=1
    mmcblk0p7\boot\zImage
    mmclbk0p7\etc\init\adbd.conf
    vinda usage
    mmcblk0p7\opt\rockrobo
    adb
    mmcblk0p7\usr\sbin\tcpdump
    mmcblk0p8\var\log\upstart\adbd.log
        passwords




syslogs


    Look for IPs, emails, host/domains, passwords, keys
    Check where DID and UID is used
    Dummy data to check if itâ€™s logged



What other files were changed?

compare against base ubuntu system?



## Interesting Binaries


    miio
    rockrobo
        rrlog
    ADB
    rriot



### adb

# Relate back to the question about  security / privacy


* Wifi password in plain text
  * wpa_supplicant --> underlying linux framework
How easy is it for someone to attack the system?

* netcat?
* There is an SSH server running (though restricted via iptables)
  * Why?
* Hands-on access a system = game over
  * But should it be?

* Some logs are encrypted locally


Are there any backdoors?

outbound requests

persistent software (install to recovery + system_a)

WiFi is always scanning

* Can I plant software (y)

---

* Why is netcat installed but not curl, wget?
* TODO: Check what gets cleared during a format / update

# Current Challenges

Electricity is dangerous.
Thank you Gigabyte for having ESD-protected USB ports

Still a lot of files

Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS was released back in 2014

# Project Timeline

#### <label>Thesis A</label>

* Initial research and research environment setup
* Teardown and initial hands-on of Roborock S6

#### <label>Thesis B - Binary Assessment</label>

* Disassembly and analysis of firmware binaries to identify vulnerabilities
  * inc. ADB binary functionality
* Search for unsecured secrets, logs, configurations

#### <label>Thesis C - Connectivity Assessment</label>

* Inspection of outbound internet traffic - security, PII, etc
* Inspection of local network traffic
* Inspection of interaction with nearby devices
* Protocol analysis


---

# [Static] Binary assessment




# Retrospective of this term

* Time management
* Work
* COVID-19

# In the mean time


# Findings




---

## Project Plan

## Revised Project Plan

---


# Next Steps

- Dump the firmware and begin RE / forensics
- Redo (and further investigate) live system analysis
  - i.e. Properly capture _all_ network traffic
