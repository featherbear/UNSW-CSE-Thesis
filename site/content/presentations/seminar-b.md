# File System Imaging

The eMMC only has 4GB of storage, so we can't (also shouldn't) image the flash onto itself... but we can image it remotely! 

```bash
IP=10.10.10.8
for partition in `ssh root@$IP "ls /dev/mmcblk0?* -1"`
do
    ssh root@$IP "sudo dd if=$partition bs=1M" | dd of=$(basename $partition).img
done
```

# Recovery Reset

Recovery supposedly resets `system_a`, `system_b`, `UDISK` and `Download`

{{%center%}}<img src="/uploads/20220501-recovery.png" width="70%"/>{{%/center%}}

What about the other partitions? If we want to plant malicious software, can put it in `recovery` and `system_a`?

## Interesting Files

mmcblk0p1/miio/device.token=utnevRELra5sqef3
mmcblk0p1/miio/device.uid=1738271950
mmcblk0p1/rockrobo/
mmcblk0p11\endpoint.bin - AWS address + key?
mmcblk0p7\boot\zImage - bootloader
vinda usage

passwords
syslogs


    Look for IPs, emails, host/domains, passwords, keys
    Check where DID and UID is used
    Dummy data to check if it‚Äôs logged



What other files were changed?

compare against base ubuntu system?

# Thesis consideration - some thoughts and discussions

<small>How have manufacturers of IoT / smart home devices addressed the increasing concerns of digital privacy and product security?</small>

{{% note %}}We're not answering the question just yet, just some thoughts{{% /note %}}

* Wireless credentials are stored in plain text
  * wpa_supplicant is part of the underlying Linux framework
* SSH server running (though iptables)
* `player` exposes port 6665
* Processes are running as root
  * Any vulnerability in any of the programs can result in system takeover, dropping of iptables, persistence planting
* Recovery partition is modifiable
  * `mount /dev/mmcblk0p7 ...`
* netcat, tcpdump, ccrypt?

* Easier to interface with devices (udev rules)

How easy is it for someone to attack the system?

##

What's Good

* iptables
* some logs are encrypted locally


* Hands-on access a system = game over
  * But should it be?



Are there any backdoors?
outbound requests
persistent software (install to recovery + system_a)


---



---

![](proc_misc.png)




* Can I plant software (y)

---

* Why is netcat installed but not curl, wget?
* TODO: Check what gets cleared during a format / update


---

# Capturing network data during device registration

* Have shell access but 
* PolarProxy is too new for Ubuntu 14.04
* apt update doesn't work with socks5:// or http proxies properly

On the smart app side

Frida nope
windows env nope

Logging program has the potential to unblock port 22?

iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport 22
```

# Retrospective

* Time management / busy / other work
* Could have done more work

---
# Project Timeline

#### <label>Thesis A</label>

* Initial research and research environment setup
* Teardown and initial hands-on of Roborock S6

#### <label>Thesis B - Binary Assessment</label>

* Disassembly and analysis of firmware binaries to identify vulnerabilities
  * inc. ADB binary functionality
* Search for unsecured secrets, logs, configurations

#### <label>Thesis C - Connectivity Assessment</label>

* Inspection of outbound internet traffic - security, PII, etc
* Inspection of local network traffic
* Inspection of interaction with nearby devices
* Protocol analysis

# [Static] Binary assessment





# In the mean time


# Findings

## Project Plan

## Revised Project Plan

---


# Next Steps

- Dump the firmware and begin RE / forensics
- Redo (and further investigate) live system analysis
  - i.e. Properly capture _all_ network traffic
