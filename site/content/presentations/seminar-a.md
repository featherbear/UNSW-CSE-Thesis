# Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Home devices are everywhere.

Q: Can we completely trust a device's {security, privacy}?  
A: <label>no</label>

* Developers are humans.
    * Humans make mistakes.
        * Developers make <s>mistakes</s> bugs

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Home devices are everywhere...  
From smart lightbulbs, to smart fridges... to ... [*] smart ... flip-flops?
We can't seem live without them, but should we really be living _with_ them?

Now regardless of where you stand in the pro or anti smart device debate, the matter of fact is that the adoption of these devices into our daily lives have been widespread.

Of course though, everything comes at a cost.
