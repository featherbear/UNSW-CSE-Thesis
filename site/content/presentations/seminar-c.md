FYI not here to tell you whether or not IOT devices are good or not... that's for you to judge. My research is on whether these big players have been doing their part (as providers) to keep us safe

IOT ecosystems often have a centralised system to manage their fleet <span style='font-size: 18px'> (devices)</span>.

<label>Pros</label>

A centralised management is <u><i>so</i></u> much simpler/easier/faster/cheaper/'better' than a decentralised one.

<label>Cons</label>  

‚ö†Ô∏è Device functionality dependent on system availability  
‚ö†Ô∏è Little transparency about what/where/when/why data is transmitted

Remotely issue firmware updates, commands, send logs, monitor network stability, etcetera

Thesis B - Firmware dump (`dd`) for offline/static analysis

<a href="https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-CSE-Thesis/posts/20220302-progress/#backup"><img round src="/uploads/20220501-0T4A9824.JPG"></a>

{{% note %}}
Could have dumped with a flash dumper but I don't own one of those!  
This does mean I only have access to the eMMC rather than being able to dump the firmware of the STM or other chips on the motherboard... but it's probably enough.  

Plus also if there's a firmware update to those chips, I could just look at that.

# Where we left off

---

## From Thesis B (security)

* Finish analysing firmware binaries
* Comparing files against the stock Ubuntu OS
* Check if an IPv6 address is assigned (hence SSH)
  * ans: [no.](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-CSE-Thesis/posts/ipv6-check/)

## From Thesis C (privacy)

* LAN/WAN traffic analysis
  * Look at network behaviour
  * Hook into transmit and receive functions (pre-encrypt / post-decrypt)
* Update to latest version <span style="font-size: 18px">(and hope we don't get locked out)</span>
  * <span style="color: grey; font-size: 18px">disclaimer: we got locked out. hahah....</span>
  * Compare file changes
* Factory reset device, check for remnant files

# More on `adbd`

<small>A novel but not-so-useful way to perform arbitrary code execution</small>

{{% section %}}
Command injection vulnerability exists within the modified `adbd` binary

![](/uploads/20220725-snipaste_2022-07-26_04-02-13.jpg)

---

## What's modified?

* Interface to perform `uart_test` and `ruby_flash`
* Authenticated access to `adb shell`
  * Dynamic challenge/response
  * Requires knowledge of `vinda`, device ID

![](/uploads/20220725-snipaste_2022-07-25_23-49-57.jpg)

---

## Auth Flow

```
SYS_PASSWD = /mnt/default/vinda := ABCD1234ABCD1234

# Get challenge
CHALLENGE $= adb shell [SYS_PASSWD]rockrobo dynamickey

# Generate response
ADB_PASSWD = generate(challenge, device_id)

# Perform command
adb shell [SYS_PASSWD][ADB_PASSWD] [COMMAND*]
```

---

## Achieving RCE

* The modified binary has some sort of access level implementation
  * Depends on value in `/mnt/default/adb.conf` (RO)

>

* Arbitrary command execution when access level = 0
  * But the app also resets this value to 1
  * <code>&</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>`</code> characters are also forbidden
>

üò¢ No arbitrary command execution...


```bash
$> py -3 adbStart "whoami"

src/rr_ruby.c::adb_check_unlock_level1():not support /adb shell sys_passwd#adb_passwd whoami in level 1
```

---

## Noooooooooo <span style="font-size: 18px">wait what</span>

![](/uploads/Snipaste_2022-07-26_05-53-34.jpg)

... where did `/bin/sh` come from..?

---

{{< slide transition="fade" >}}

## RCE via command substitution

![](/uploads/20220725-snipaste_2022-07-26_03-56-14.jpg)

Avoiding the forbidden characters (<code>&</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>`</code>) we can exploit command substitution and redirections to inject commands.

> Allows us to write to the filesystem

---

{{< slide transition="fade" >}}

## RCE via command substitution

> Or read from the filesystem too!

![](/uploads/20220725-snipaste_2022-07-26_04-02-13.jpg)


---

## POC breakdown <span style="font-size: 18px">(Where it falls apart)</span>

* Still need to authenticate before RCE possible
  * Still need knowledge of the `/mnt/default/vinda` file
  * Need to physically open the device at least once
    * Screws. Lots of them.

>

* At least, provides a way to issue commands even when `adb_lock != 0`
  * USB protocol is more common and accessible to people
  * SSH access might stop working / be blocked <span style="color: grey; font-size: 12px">(spoilers)</span> <!-- i.e. network issues -->
  * Serial access might stop working / be blocked <span style="color: grey; font-size: 12px">(spoilers)</span> <!-- not everyone has a UART cable -->

{{% note %}}
Now that we're throwing in a new firmware version, or a few new versions actually...  
What's the best way to explore these?

All of firmware A, then all of firmware B, then all of firmware C?

Or topic 1, firmware A and B and C
then topic 2, firmware A and B and C

The second idea is probably better - as we should be focussing on the _changes_ (i.e. efforts that the company has done) between firmware version

<label>Aside</label>

* The Roborock S6 was released in June 2019
* The unit I have was manufactured June 2020
  * My unit has a newer base firmware (25th March 2020)
* Note the presence of "<label>MI</label>" at the start of the product string

## Stock Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

Performed a `diff` check against the [Ubuntu 14.04.3 Core LTS (armhf)](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/14.04/release/ubuntu-base-14.04.3-core-armhf.tar.gz) OS.

> 

* All binaries present on the device matched, <i>except</i> for `ntpdate` (synchronise computer time via NTP)
* Still functionally equivalent

-

> probably more updates (got locked out)

> 02.29.02 (28th April 2022)
* /opt/rockrobo/rriot/rriot_rr enabled
```

---

## Getting locked out - `rr_login`

```md{5}
...
* /opt/rockrobo/rriot/rriot_rr added (but not enabled)

> 01.19.98 (9th June 2020)
* Serial handler changed to /sbin/rr_login

> 01.20.76 (23rd June 2020)
-
...
```

After the <label>v01.19.98</label> update, serial shell access was denied, uh oh!

{{% note %}}
Did the password change?  
Did I break something?  
Is this the end?  
{{% /note %}}

---

## Lockdown: Shell

* Serial handler no longer uses `getty`
  * Now uses modified version called [`rr_login`](posts/sbin-rr_login/)
* OpenSSH server was replaced with modified version of `dropbear`

>

Both only allow login as the `root` user

## Lockdown: Authentication

The `vinda` file is no longer used for auth!  

>

Login attempts now verify against
* `[mmcblk0p6]/shadow`
* `[mmcblk0p6]/shadow.sign`.

> But these files don't exist on my device...

Affected: `rr_login` (serial), `dropbear` (SSH), `adbd`? (USB)

## System Changes

* Are we still using Ubuntu?
  * Maybe? <!-- /etc/os-release seems too say so, but it could be a leftover artifact -->
  * `apt-get` and `dpkg` removed
* Lots of tools were replaced with BusyBox (v1.24.1)
  * Also a space-saving measure
  * ![](/uploads/20220724-snipaste_2022-07-25_02-50-06.jpg)
* Effectively now running embedded Linux

---

## Lockdown: Firewall

* There are now `ip6tables` rules to drop all packets üëè
    * Apps also no longer perform IPv6 (AAAA) DNS requests <!-- i.e. rrlogd: fds -->

>

* Processes have calls to reinstate dropping SSH access
    * `rrlogd` now drops access on bad version match
        * (previously _only_ allowed access on correct version match)
    * `WatchDoge` immediately drops access on start

&nbsp;

## `rrlogd` and `wlanmgr`

`wlanmgr` now has the functionality to call `tcpdump`
<!-- * `rrlogd` receives `MSG_LOG_DEBUG_ENABLE` event -->

>

<!-- `MSG_LOG_DEBUG_UPLOAD_DATA` event -->
`rrlogd` will upload the following

|Content|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|`/etc/resolv.conf`|DNS resolvers|
|`netstat -anp`|All sockets and their PIDs|
|`ifconfig`|Network interface status|
|PCAP|Packet capture|

<!-- ![](/uploads/20220711-snipaste_2022-07-12_03-58-09.jpg) -->

<!-- ---
## `rriot_rr`

New file, not used unless `/dev/shm/.migrate_to_rriot` exists and is populated

---

## `rriot_tuya`

Used to have the `tuya_iot_impl_upload_file` function but has been removed
 -->

{{% /section %}}

# What else is uploaded (`rrlogd`)?

{{% section %}}

> What can the manufacturer see?

* Device data
* Application config
* Application logs
* SLAM (map)
* Running processes
* Wireless configuration
* Packet capture
* Blackbox (statistics)

> See: [Privacy Policy](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-CSE-Thesis/posts/privacy-policy-from-apk/)

{{% note %}}
It inadvertently uploads the device's wireless network credentials (because of app logs), though there is realistically no need for the manufacturer to know this.

Also - the device can't connect without being connected to a wireless network with an internet connection. So the reason of 'troubleshooting connectivity issues' is rather moot.

## Network Geomap <span style="font-size: 24px">(FW v02.29.02) (exc FDS) (1 week)</span>

![](/uploads/20220724-m2-a2-geomap.png)

---

## Observations

* Local traffic - DHCP (5min), Tuya Discovery (5s)
* Connections to America, Germany, China
  * America, Germany - AWS - `fds`, `a2`, `ms`, `m2`
  * <span style="color: grey">China - Mi IO Cloud (v01.15.58 only)</span>
* Increased network activity at 3am <!-- MQTT, A2 -->
  * 3am AEDT is 12am in Beijing
  * Connections are being established - possible timeout/reconnect

## Changes

* New FW uses `m2.tuyaeu.com` instead of `ms.tuyaeu.com`
* New FW no longer polls `xx.ot[t].io.mi.com`

---

## What's in the packet?

> Most (if not all) communications were encrypted

<s>1. Break the encryption</s> too much effort

1. Hook into the pre-encryption / post-decryption stages

```
/* Send test to 10.251.252.253:28422 */
void hook(void* data, uint data_len) {
  int sock = create_udp4_connection(IPV4_ADDR(10,251,252,253), 28422);
  send(sock, data, data_len, 0);
}
```

2. Just look at the app logs<i>*</i>

<small><i>*: Application logs are less verbose in newer FW versions<br />
However they communicate the same way as the older FW versions</i></small>

# Demos and POCs

{{% note %}}
Before we look at threats, let's look at some fun stuff!
{{% /note %}}

---

# Remote Access (across the internet!!!)

* Easy to perform - system has required libraries and network stack
* e.g. Reverse SSH
* e.g. VPN / SD-WAN

# Upgrade Persistence <span style="font-size: 24px">([see concept post](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-CSE-Thesis/posts/achieving-upgrade-persistence/))</span>


![](/uploads/20220711-snipaste_2022-07-12_04-24-24.jpg)


{{% section %}}

## Upgrade procedure

* Download the update to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p1`</span> (data)
* Extract update to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p10`</span> (updbuf)
* Unmount <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p8`</span> (bootA) / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p9`</span> (bootB)
* Flash <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`updbuf`</span> to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span>
* Boot into <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span>
* Flash <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`updbuf`</span> to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span>
* Boot into <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span>

>

Both filesystems are overwritten (existing changes will disappear)

---

## Achieving upgrade persistence

* Download the update to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p1`</span> (data)
* Extract update to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p10`</span> (updbuf)
* üìù <span style="color: #b94357">Modify contents of <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`updbuf`</span></span>
* Unmount <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p8`</span> (bootA) / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`mmcblk0p9`</span> (bootB)
* Flash <span style="color: #b94357">modified</span> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`updbuf`</span> to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span>
* Boot into <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span>
* Flash <span style="color: #b94357">modified</span> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`updbuf`</span> to <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span>
* Boot into <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootB`</span> / <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey">`bootA`</span>

>

Modify the extracted updated firmware, so changes propagate

---

## How to modify?

* Alter the <label>`SysUpdate`</label> binary to include modification steps
* Service / cron / repeated task to write into `/mnt/updbuf`

{{% note %}}
Altering the `SysUpdate` binary is probably more reliable.  
If using a repeated or scheduled task - we'd have to have a fast loop to intercept the extraction - but a lesser loop period means more wasted executions
{{% /note %}}

---

## What to modify?

* Remote access
  * `/etc/passwd`
  * `/usr/bin/adbd`
  * `/usr/sbin/dropbear`
  * VPN / SD-WAN
  * iptables <span style="font-size: 0.6em">(various locations)</span>
* üîä Sounds?
* Future upgrade persistence
  * `SysUpdate`
  * Scheduled / repeated jobs

# OTA Rooting 

{{% section %}}

{
  "method": "miIO.ota",
  "params": {
    "mode": "normal",

    "proc": "dnld install"
  },
  "id": 474627483
}
```

During device initialisation, an OTA update payload could be sent...  
[Remote root / backdoor](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-CSE-Thesis/posts/ota-updates-blocked-as-of-late-2019/)!!

> However... patched a long time ago

---

* OTA updates during device initialisation were disabled in a November 2019 firmware update.
  - Remember - Product was released June 2019 <!-- ours was manufactured 06/2020 -->
* This method of attack is limited to devices that are
  * Not yet initialised (else will have to be factory reset)
  * Manufactured within 4 months of the device being first sold
